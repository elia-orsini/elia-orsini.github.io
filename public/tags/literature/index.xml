      <description>The Glass Bead Game by Herman Hesse is a biography written by a historian in the year 2400 about an elite of people which decide to live alienated from society to study and preserve all the culture accumulated in the centuries.
Even though it is a fictional book, it feels more real than anything. Everything seems just like a metaphor where the authorâ€™s aim is talking to you about his own path from great expectations and convictions about the meaning of the world to an existential crisis where every certainty about your life vanishes.</description>
