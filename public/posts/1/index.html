This precariousness, which has been protracted for decades since the 1929 market crash, has proved how the current economic system is not working properly under the present conditions.\nAfter the first World War, the 1920s were defined as the “roaring twenties” because of the increasing economic prosperity of those years. Approaching the end of the decade, optimism was so prevalent that some economists arrived at saying that a permanently high plateau was reached by the stock markets. With this confidence in the markets, consumers thought that borrowing money would have been resonable. Indeed, in the course of nine years the Dow Jones had increased in value tenfold. However, the popular sentiment, as is the case most of the time, was completely wrong. In march 1929 the first signals of an inherent economic crash started to appear with speculators starting to sell quickly exposing the foundational instability of the economic market. But the crisis we all know and the one which is described in history books do not show the date March 1929. Indeed, the situation was temporary “repaired” in March by banks, which started emitting credit to help stop the small market crash. This temporary solution proved to be later even worse, causing the market crash we all know in the following October.\nThe causes of this inability of the system to be stable can probably be reconducted to multiple factors. In this situation, I will only try to report a possible defect of the current system and propose a solution. The problem I will focus on is the zero partial reserve requirements under all demand deposits. This lack of a fixed minimum rate can be very problematic because it signifies that banks are allowed to lend money they don’t actually have, causing a virtual injection of money into the system. Under the system reported by Irving Fisher in his ‘100% Money’, he explains that banks need to actually have in their reserves only 10% of the money they lend. This 10%, however, is not actual cash. Instead, it is mainly composed of demand deposits in the Federal Reserve bank. The Federal Reserve, again, has a legal requirement to only have 35% of the entire value of demand deposits stored in cash. Therefore, out of every dollar that banks lend to the public, only 3.5% (35% of 10%) of it needs to actually exist according to the law. This situation, according to Irving Fisher is one of the main causes of great depressions. He describes how economic crisis are initially caused by an excess of short term debt (which produces an excess of circulating supply) as seen in the months before the 1929 economic crash, and then a too great contraction of the circulating supply which causes deflation and the consequent depression. These cycles of excessive expansion and contraction of the circulating supply could then represent one of the causes of our economic booms and busts.\nA possible solution to the following problem was first proposed by the “Chicago Plan for Banking Reform” which proposed a 100% minimum reserve requirement for banks to lend money to the public. This plan would then stabilise the circulating supply to a fixed limit and guarantee that all bank deposits have an actual cash correspondence in the bank register. With this system, new money could then be emitted to sustain economic growth by a Public Money Administration as described by Yamaguchi in “Peer-to-Peer Public Money System” (2016). Banks would then become only intermediaries without being able to excessively influence the entire economy. Furthermore, the redistribution of income would probably become more fair and balanced between the financial sector and the real sector because banks would not be allowed anymore to lend money (and therefore make a profit) from assets they do not have and that do not actually exist. Capitalism (and the excessive concentration of profits in the financial sector) would then not be that extreme anymore resulting in a more balanced economy.\n",
